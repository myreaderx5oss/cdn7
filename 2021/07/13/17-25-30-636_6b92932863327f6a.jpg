going the way of the dodo bird for many companies, regulators and platforms, and that&#8217;s giving a new emphasis on technology that will help companies better manage their customer data on their own steam. Today, one of the companies building tools for that end is announcing a big round of funding, underscoring its growth.<\/p>\n<p>Amperity, which provides a customer data platform for its businesses, has raised $100 million in funding at a valuation of over $1 billion. The startup typically works with large, consumer-focused enterprises along the lines of Starbucks, Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, Patagonia and some 100 others, helping them to tap and organize their own data troves better to develop better profiles of their customers.<\/p>\n<p>The Series D funding &#8212; led by HighSage Ventures with previous backers Tiger Global Management, Declaration Partners, Madrona Venture Group and Madera Technology Partners also participating &#8212; brings the total raised by Amperity to $187 million and comes two years after the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Series C of $50 million<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The last year of increased online activity and online shopping has put a much bigger focus on the data that companies are amassing about their users and how they can better leverage that information to grow further. Amperity said that in 2020, annual recurring revenues were up 100%, partly on the back of that surge of interest in how to tap into customer data, not least because the older way of doing things has fallen out of favor.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CJoPmmZDD6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/\">Customer data management company Amperity raises $50M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Customer data management company Amperity raises $50M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/embed\/#?secret=CJoPmmZDD6\" data-secret=\"CJoPmmZDD6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Indeed, Kabir Shahani, the CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Derek Slager, believes that the trend away from third-party to first-party data has played and will play a much bigger role in Amperity&#8217;s growth longer term.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID certainly &#8216;helped,&#8217; &#8221; Shahani said, &#8220;but to me the story is less about that and more about how our idea has been validated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The idea he and Slager had been thinking about was the dependency, and problems with, third-party cookies, an issue that has been lingering &#8220;for decades,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When this idea started percolating, when we looked to start the company, we thought this must have already been solved.

It\u2019s a gap <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marcofi.com\/\">Marco Financial<\/a> is looking to bridge through its tech-enabled risk assessment platform that can provide better insight on who should receive loans.<\/p>\n<p>To continue its mission, the Miami-based trade finance company raised $7 million in seed funding and $75 million in a credit facility, led by Arcadia Funds LLC and Kayyak Ventures, to increase its credit line to $100 million. Marco was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies\/\">backed last September by a small seed round<\/a> from Struck Capital and Antler and over $20 million in a credit facility underwritten by Arcadia Funds.<\/p>\n<p>Additional investors in the newest seed round and expanded credit facility include Village Global VC, Flexport Ventures, Tresalia Capital, 342 Capital, Struck Capital, Antler LLC, Antler Elevate, Florida Funders and Fox Ventures. Strategic angel investors include Phil Bentley, CEO of Mitie, and Naman Budhdeo, co-founder and CEO of TripStack and FlightNetwork.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Jacob Shoihet, Marco\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says not only is there a roughly $350 billion trade finance market to go after, but cited data learned from Javier Urrutia, director of Foreign Investments at PROCOLOMBIA, an organization that promotes foreign investment and nontraditional exports in Colombia, that for every 1% increase in export productivity, 500,000 new jobs can be created.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor small and medium businesses in trade, this is important for companies creating a high level of job growth and lowering the poverty rate,\u201d Shoihet told TechCrunch. \u201cBy making it easier for businesses to transcend the 30, 60, 90 and now even 120 days they wait to be paid for supplies, we can solve that gap and unlock billions in value so that companies can scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NNYVSNtKRv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies\/\">Miami-based Marco Financial is launching a revenue-based lending service for Latin American SMEs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Miami-based Marco Financial is launching a revenue-based lending service for Latin American SMEs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies\/embed\/#?secret=NNYVSNtKRv\" data-secret=\"NNYVSNtKRv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Shoihet met his co-founder and COO Peter D. Spradling through the Antler accelerator, a Singapore- and New York-based early-stage investment and advisory services program that connects entrepreneurs and tech operators to launch new businesses. They started Marco in 2019 and now have offices in New York, Dallas and across Latin America.<\/p>\n<p>Spradling was born in Uruguay and knows firsthand about the challenges of importing and exporting from working in his family\u2019s slaughterhouse and later founding three of his own companies. In fact, one of his businesses imported e-cigarettes \u2014 his mother was a lifelong smoker, and he wanted to help her quit. He recalls pre-selling his inventory at a discount in order to get the money to import the goods.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBanks don\u2019t like risk, which means businesses spend most of their time trying to get financing rather than increasing sales,\u201d Spradling told TechCrunch. \u201cBanks in Latin America have a saying that \u2018they lend money to people who don\u2019t need it.\u2019 Families with money can access the banks, but you can\u2019t launch a business without capital, and many owners lack that access to banks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marco\u2019s factoring product enables new companies to get started without having to put up the significant amount of collateral that banks are asking. Banks typically look at financial statements for the past two years of the business and give a line of credit accordingly. Not needing as much collateral also enables more women in Latin America to become business owners because they often don\u2019t have collateral, Spradling said.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, Marco reduces risk by basing its lines of credit on an analysis of the future potential of the business, thereby freeing up cash so that small and medium exporters can continue their operations and invest in their growth. The company is able to show what kind of financing can be obtained based on the amount of data customers provide. Marco also said it can reduce the loan origination process from over two months to one week and provide funding to approved exporters within 24 hours.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qTXbm9W76i\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/17\/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains\/\">How tech can build more resilient supply chains<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How tech can build more resilient supply chains&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/17\/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains\/embed\/#?secret=qTXbm9W76i\" data-secret=\"qTXbm9W76i\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Crist\u00f3bal Silva Lombardi, general partner at Kayyak Ventures, told TechCrunch that Marco is providing an alternative for small and medium exporters to access capital that they previously had to get from friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>In countries like Chile, electronic invoicing innovation has enabled the factoring industry to grow, and in turn, companies like Marco tend to become leaders in supply chain financing and shrink the high interest rates spread between small businesses and large firms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarco wants to take that worldwide,\u201d Silva Lombardi said. \u201cThere is a lot of value to tackle. Factoring is one of the corners in the financing market that hasn\u2019t been tackled, and by using technology, Marco is building and creating value for the whole society. This is where venture capital firms should be putting their dollars \u2014 in companies where technology and talent unleash a lot of value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since launching its product in January 2020, the company has processed thousands of invoices across 20 countries, amounting to more than $18 million.<\/p>\n<p>However, it wasn\u2019t easy in the beginning, according to Shoihet. Starting during the global pandemic, Marco initially had challenges accessing the market due to exports and supply chains being strained.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Marco has found its groove and is lending as little as $25,000 per month and as much as $10 million, Shoihet said.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the new funding will go toward simplifying cross-border payments, assessing risk and productizing ways to take unstructured data, processes and work to create a better experience for the customer. The company also said it aims to give large logistics providers the ability to finance exports on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Marco was also able to attract new leadership, including Prajwal Manalwar, chief product officer, and Sabrina Teichman, chief growth officer. Manalwar worked for 13 years at PayPal, where he most recently was a product lead focused on debit card authorization rates and in-store payments. Teichman joins after 11 years with the U.S. government, most recently serving as managing director for the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow we can work on how to solve the problem at a larger scale by building infrastructure and information through the underwriting process and through partnerships from larger players in shipping, trade services and insurance \u2014 all incumbent industries that have clients with working capital,\u201d Shoihet said. \u201cBy innovating the underwriting process, we can come to better conclusions and be the trade finance-as-a-service provider to clients in emerging markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"n44KRXor5F\"><p><a

It also includes investments from 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Houseparty co-founder Sima Sistani.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI firmly believe we are missing out on transformational ideas by not putting resources behind women,\u201d said Melinda French Gates, founder of Pivotal Ventures, in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve invested in the Female Founders Fund because we need women founders and funders at the table if we want to build a more prosperous and inclusive economy for everyone. New and innovative ideas come from everywhere; we can&#8217;t keep looking in the same old packages.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fund III brings FFF\u2019s total assets under management to over $95 million since it was formed in 2014 to invest in female-founded technology companies and lifestyle brands. The third fund\u2019s portfolio is already 70% invested in BIPOC founders, which stands for Black, Indigenous and people of color, Anu Duggal, founding partner of Female Founders Fund, told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>FFF began raising its third fund in 2020, making its first close just before the global pandemic locked everything down. That didn\u2019t slow down Duggal\u2019s ability to meet potential investors, which she said was done from her kitchen table.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was an incredible testament to how fast so much can be done without the flights and in-person meetings, which does take a bunch of time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think investors felt the same because March through June was preoccupied with making sure portfolio companies were in a good spot.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"g56cOlkmgw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/anu-duggal-on-covid-19-promoting-diversity-and-building-a-fund\/\">Anu Duggal on COVID-19, promoting diversity and building a fund<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Anu Duggal on COVID-19, promoting diversity and building a fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/21\/anu-duggal-on-covid-19-promoting-diversity-and-building-a-fund\/embed\/#?secret=g56cOlkmgw\" data-secret=\"g56cOlkmgw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The new fund is a continuation of FFF\u2019s existing strategy \u2014 essentially doubling down on investing in female, women of color and LGBTQ+ founders who are building companies at the seed stage. The biggest differentiator with the third fund is that FFF will be able to increase its check sizes to between $750,000 to $1 million, Duggal said. Half of the fund will go to follow-on funding.<\/p>\n<p>While fundraising over the past 18 months, Duggal said she was inspired by the momentum of female-led companies going public, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/02\/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service\/\">Bumble<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/04\/23andme-set-to-go-public-via-a-virgin-group-spac-merger\/\">23andMe<\/a> and Figs, which also drove investor backing of the new fund, she added.<\/p>\n<p>Fund III\u2019s fundraising goal is in line with the transition from FFF\u2019s previous funds: Fund I was $6 million and Fund II was $25 million. So far, FFF has invested in more than 50 female-led companies nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>To date, FFF has invested in seven companies from Fund III, including a few that haven\u2019t been announced yet or are in stealth mode. Duggal expects to be able to invest in 25 companies from this fund.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the companies are pre-launch, so there aren\u2019t early successes quite yet, but one of the first investments was in an at-home blood test created by one of Facebook\u2019s female engineers, she said. FFF was able to bring in Anne Wojcicki as an angel investor.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1Bq28HH1c3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020\/\">Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020\/embed\/#?secret=1Bq28HH1c3\" data-secret=\"1Bq28HH1c3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cOne of our themes is consumerization of digital health, and this is a great example,\u201d Duggal said. \u201cIt can be annoying to have to go get blood drawn, and this is putting the experience and the data in the hands of the consumer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Female Founders Fund is also looking at startups focused on the development of the workplace \u2014 tools for employees, small businesses and creators. Most everyone had to adjust to a pandemic working lifestyle, and the firm doesn\u2019t see that ending soon.<\/p>\n<p>Two newer areas of focus are climate change and education. Within education, FFF sees a trend in opportunities for technology to enable senior citizens to remain mentally engaged through continuing education. The firm is also looking at the climate market for technology to replace plastic food containers, refillable solutions, alternatives to meat and ways to record carbon usages on a daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom day one, we have been committed to building the largest and most powerful network of female operators in technology,\u201d Duggal added. \u201cWe are happy with the support we have received from Anne Wojcicki and Susan Wojcicki, Houseparty and some of our founders, as well as Melinda French Gates.

billion euros after finding major breaches in how it negotiated with publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content &#8212; as is required under a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/26\/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform\/\">pan-EU reform of digital copyright law<\/a> which extended neighbouring rights to news

&#8212; when it said it would be paying news publishers \u201cto create and curate high-quality content\u201d to appear on its platforms.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, the move that looked intended to shrink Google&#8217;s exposure to legal mandates to pay publishers for content reuse by pushing them to accept commercial terms which give it broad rights to &#8216;showcase&#8217; their content.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>France&#8217;s watchdog has now called out &#8212; and sanctioned &#8212; the practice.<\/p>\n<p>The half a billion euro penalty is also notable for being considerably more than Google had already agreed to pay French publishers, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-google-france-copyright-exclusive-idUSKBN2AC27N\">Reuters<\/a> &#8212; which reported, back in February, that the tech giant had inked a deal with a group of 121 publishers to pay them just $76M over three years.<\/p>\n<p>France&#8217;s competition authority <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr\/fr\/article\/remuneration-des-droits-voisins-lautorite-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-500-millions-deuros\">said today<\/a> that it&#8217;s applying the sanction of \u20ac500 million ($592M) against the tech giant for failing to comply with a number of injunctions related to its earlier, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/09\/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse\/\">April 2020 decision<\/a> &#8212; when the watchdog ordered Google to negotiate in good faith with publishers to remunerate them for displaying their protected content.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, Google sought to evade the neighbouring news right by stopping displaying snippets of content alongside links it showed in Google News in France. But the watchdog found that was likely to be an abuse of its dominant position &#8212; and ordered Google to stop circumventing the law and negotiate with publishers to pay for the reuse in good faith.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r5bx5CKu02\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/09\/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse\/\">France&#8217;s competition watchdog orders Google to pay for news reuse<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

in negotiations with publishers &#8212; pushing for the legal neighbouring right to be incorporated as &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">an ancillary component with no separate financial valuation&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Publishers requests to break out copyright remuneration negotiations were denied, per the watchdog&#8217;s investigation.<\/p>\n<p>It also found Google &#8220;unjustifiably&#8221; reduced the scope of negotiations with regard to the scope of income derived from the display of protected news content &#8212; with Google telling publishers that only advertising income from Google Search pages posting news content should be taken into account in determining the level of remuneration due.<\/p>\n<p>The authority found this exclusion of income from other Google services and all indirect income related to this content to be in breach of the copyright law and its earlier compliance order.<\/p>\n<p>Google also &#8220;deliberately circumscribed&#8221; the scope of the law on neighboring rights by excluding titles that do not have a Political and General Information certificate &#8212; which the watchdog couched as a &#8220;bad faith&#8221; interpretation of the code on intellectual property.<\/p>\n<p>It also found the tech giant sought to exclude press agencies from renumeration related to their content when used by third party publishers &#8212; highlighting that as another breach of its April 2020 decision, by further noting: &#8220;The French legislator has been very explicit on the need to include press agencies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In another finding, it said Google had only provided publishers with &#8220;partial&#8221; and &#8220;insufficient&#8221; information for a &#8220;transparency assessment of renumeration due&#8221;; and further accused the tech giant of delaying until just a few days before the injunction deadline to provide it &#8212; so of being &#8220;late&#8221; too.<\/p>\n<p>The authority&#8217;s investigation highlights compliance problems with another injunction &#8212; related to an obligation of neutrality in how protected content is presented on Google&#8217;s platforms &#8212; with the watchdog writing on that: &#8220;The strategy put in place by Google has thus strongly encouraged publishers to accept the contractual conditions of the <em>Showcase<\/em>\u00a0service\u00a0and to renounce negotiations relating specifically to the current uses of protected content, which was the subject of the Injunctions, under penalty of seeing their exposure and their remuneration degraded compared to their competitors who would have accepted the proposed terms.\u00a0Google cannot therefore claim to have taken the necessary measures to prevent its negotiations from affecting the presentation of protected content in its services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another injunction sought to prevent Google from seeking to leverage its dominance by offsetting remunerations paid to publishers for the neighbouring rights.<\/p>\n<p>On this the watchdog also took issue with its approach &#8212; noting that its Showcase product requires publishers to make not just snippets of their content available for display on Google&#8217;s platforms but &#8220;large extracts&#8221; and even whole articles.<\/p>\n<p>It also found that Google linked\u00a0participation in the\u00a0<em>Showcase<\/em>\u00a0program\u00a0to subscription to another service called <em>Subscribe with Google<\/em> (SwG) &#8212; enabling it to link negotiation on neighboring rights with the subscription of new services that could financially benefit its business.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MUKLVkgHz9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/21\/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse\/\">Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuse<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

&#8212; and of continuing an already years-long &#8220;opposition strategy&#8221; to the principle of neighbouring rights; and then, after they&#8217;d been baked into EU and French law, seeking to &#8220;minimize the concrete scope of those rights as much as possible&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Google has, the authority asserts, sought to use a global strategy to close down publishers&#8217; ability to negotiate for remuneration for their content reuse at a national level &#8212; using its Showcase product as a cloak for &#8220;avoiding or limiting as much as possible&#8221; payments to publishers; and, simultaneously, seeking to use negotiations on neighboring rights as an opportunity to obtain access to new content by press publishers that could allow it to collect additional income, such as from subscriptions to press titles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The sanction of 500 million euros takes into account the exceptional seriousness of the breaches observed and that the behavior of Google has further delayed the proper application of the law on neighboring rights, which aimed to better take into account the value of content from publishers and news agencies included on the platforms. The Authority will be extremely vigilant about the correct application of its decision, as non-execution can now lead to periodic penalty payments,&#8221; added the watchdog&#8217;s president, Isabelle de Silva, in a statement (which we&#8217;ve translated from French).<\/p>\n<p>The half a billion euro fine and the warning to Google that its practices will attract daily fines if it persists in ignoring the injunctions put the tech giant on notice that the detail of commercial deals won&#8217;t be allowed to fly under the radar in France.<\/p>\n<p>Any more attempts to shape a self-serving version of &#8216;compliance&#8217; are likely to attract further sanction from the watchdog &#8212; which also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/07\/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments\/\">applied a number of interoperability requirements<\/a> on Google&#8217;s ad business (and slapped it with a $268M fine), also acting on complaints from publishers.<\/p>\n<p>While anything Google agrees to in France on the neighbouring rights issue is likely to set the bar for what it can achieve with commercial deals elsewhere &#8212; at least in other EU markets, where the copyright extension also applies (once it&#8217;s been transposed into a Member State&#8217;s national law).<\/p>\n<p>In a statement responding to the authority&#8217;s sanction, Google expressed disappointment with the outcome of the investigation &#8212; claiming to have acted in good faith throughout negotiations with publishers:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe are very disappointed with this decision &#8212; we have acted in good faith throughout the entire process. The fine ignores our efforts to reach an agreement, and the reality of how news works on our platforms. To date, Google is the only company to have announced agreements on neighbouring rights. We are also about to finalize an agreement with AFP that includes a global licensing agreement, as well as the remuneration of their neighbouring rights for their press publications.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The tech giant went on to suggest that the authority&#8217;s decision is &#8220;primarily&#8221; related to negotiations in France which took place between May and September 2020, further claiming it has continued to engage with publishers and press agencies since then to find &#8220;solutions&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>By way of example it pointed to a January 2021 framework agreement inked with the Alliance de la Presse d\u2019Information G\u00e9n\u00e9rale &#8212; which it claims covers every IPG title (Information de Presse G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) in a &#8220;transparent and non-discriminatory way&#8221;. It also pointed to agreements it has inked with other publications in the market, including Le Monde, Courrier International, L&#8217;Obs, Le Figaro, Lib\u00e9ration, and L\u2019Express.<\/p>\n<p>Google also reiterated its confident it can sign a global licensing agreement with Agence France Presse &#8212; which it said it also wants to include remuneration of neighbouring rights for press publications from the agency.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our objective remains the same: We want to turn the page with a definitive agreement,&#8221; it added, saying it would take the French Competition Authority\u2019s &#8220;feedback into consideration and adapt our offers&#8221; and that: &#8220;We are already engaging with press publishers and agencies beyond IPG, by covering publications that are recognised by the CPPAP as &#8216;online press services&#8217;, and we reiterate our offer to have an independent third party in a position to evaluate our offers and allow us to base our discussions on facts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other major fines for Google in France in recent years include the aforementioned <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/07\/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments\/\">$268M for adtech abuses<\/a> last month; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent\/\">$120 for dropping tracking cookies without consent<\/a> back in December; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/20\/france-slaps-google-with-166m-antitrust-fine-for-opaque-and-inconsistent-ad-rules\/\">$166M in December 2019<\/a> for opaque and inconsistent ad rules; and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/21\/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr\/\">$57M for privacy violations<\/a> in January 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the EU, Australia <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers\/\">recently passed a law<\/a> which requires tech giants, Google and Facebook, to enter mandatory arbitration with publishers for reuse of their content if they fail to agree commercial terms on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Its law has attracted considerable attention worldwide as legislators grapple with how to rein in powerful tech platforms and ensure the sustainability of traditional news businesses whose revenues have been hit by the Internet-driven shift to digital publishing.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms\/\">UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority<\/a> has, for example, described Australia&#8217;s backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations fail as a \u201csensible\u201d approach &#8212; at at time when the government is working on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all\/\">shaping an ex ante regulation regime<\/a> to enable competition authorities to pro-actively tackle abuses by platforms with strategic market power.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of Australia&#8217;s law being passed, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/google-threatens-to-close-its-search-engine-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-digital-news-code\/\">Google had warned that it might have to close its services in the country<\/a> if legislators went ahead and also suggested the quality could degrade or that it may have to start to charge for products. In the event, it did not shut up shop down under.<\/p>\n<p>The tech giant was also an active lobbyist against the EU&#8217;s plan to extend digital copyright to cover snippets of news content &#8212; and, as recently as <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/perspectives\/richard-gingras\/how-google-invests-news\/\">2019<\/a>, it was vowing never to pay for news.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later it announced the $1BN pot to pay publishers to licence content. But Google&#8217;s eventual bill for its ad business piggybacking upon others&#8217; journalism may be rather larger than that.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7tWNg7QmMx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase\/\">Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/01\/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase\/embed\/#?secret=7tWNg7QmMx\" data-secret=\"7tWNg7QmMx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7vCHx6GVjC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers\/\">After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers\/embed\/#?secret=7vCHx6GVjC\" data-secret=\"7vCHx6GVjC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yKRGJvUymY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/google-threatens-to-close-its-search-engine-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-digital-news-code\/\">Google threatens to close its search engine in Australia as it lobbies against digital news code<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google threatens to close its search engine in Australia as it lobbies against digital news code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/google-threatens-to-close-its-search-engine-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-digital-news-code\/embed\/#?secret=yKRGJvUymY\" data-secret=\"yKRGJvUymY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>France has hit Google with a fine of half a billion euros after finding major breaches in how it negotiated with publishers to remunerate them for reuse of their content &#8212; as is required under a pan-EU reform of digital copyright law which extended neighbouring rights to news snippets.

America to double number of EV chargers as wave of electric vehicles come to market"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025.<\/p>\n<p>The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations \u2014 or 10,000 individual chargers \u2014 will be installed and operational by that time. The vast majority (some 1,700 stations) will be installed in the United States with the remainder in Canada. This will build off of EA&#8217;s plans to have about 800 charging stations and about 3,500 individual chargers in the U.S. by the end of 2021.\u00a0 As of today, Electrify America has installed 635 charging stations in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The plan is part of parent company VW Group&#8217;s announcement Monday to increase public charging infrastructure in North America, Asia and Europe. The expansion aims to increase the number of 150 and 350 kilowatt chargers, or fast chargers. VW nor EA disclosed how much money would be spent to meet this new plan. However, an EA spokesperson did confirm that the company would be spending more than the $2 billion it previously committed to invest into clean energy infrastructure over a 10-year period that kicked off in 2017.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The decision to double its charging infrastructure in North America was prompted by the rapid growth expected of electric vehicles by virtually all the auto manufacturers, according to a statement by Electrify America president and CEO Giovanni Palazzo.<\/p>\n<p>The EV market was once the primary domain of Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and GM&#8217;s Chevrolet Bolt EV. And while the majority of vehicles on the road today are gas and diesel-powered, an increasing number of other EV models have, or are about, to come to market, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Porsche Taycan and the Cross Turismo variant, Hyundai Kona Electric, Jaguar I-Pace, Rivian R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and the VW ID. 4.<\/p>\n<p>Electrify America&#8217;s initial plan was to invest more than $2 billion over a 10-year period into clean energy infrastructure and education. Of that funding, some $800 million was earmarked for California, the largest EV market in North America. This latest boost will be used to increase chargers in established EV regions in the U.S. such as California as well as push into new states, including Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also adding chargers to a stretch of highway in the upper Midwest, following similar efforts to promote cross-country travel. The subsidiary Electrify Canada will expand its network to nine provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Electrify Canada will also add more stations to British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, the four provinces where it already has a presence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal, said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025.

pay attention to Biden&#8217;s capital gains tax plans<\/a><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">There\u2019s a reason<\/span> startup compensation packages usually include equity, or stock options. For one, it\u2019s a way for startups to remain competitive in the job market and attract top talent. But it\u2019s also a way to reward those employees who join early and give them a tangible reason to stay incentivized to grow the company.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that while many employees do understand that their equity compensation could mean a big payday in the future \u2014 and, in 2021, that\u2019s more likely than ever \u2014 they don\u2019t often understand the inevitable complexities of their stock options. That puts employees at risk of not getting the most value after an IPO or, worse, losing them.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven\u2019t thought much about it, you\u2019re not alone. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to share three things all employees joining a startup should do with their equity:<\/p>\n<h2>Understand how to value your equity \u2014 and when it can change<\/h2>\n<p>While many startups are getting better at proactively communicating the value of your equity package upfront, some are still figuring out the best way to do it. That\u2019s because, unlike the more straightforward number of a salary, stock options are more nuanced \u2014 they\u2019re a living, breathing type of compensation.<\/p>\n<p>The most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.<\/p>\n<p>The 409A valuation is based on your company\u2019s valuation. This is also referred to as the fair market value (FMV). The 409A valuation can, and does, often change &#8212; they have to be updated at least once a year by a third-party valuator in order to meet tax rules. The 409A also changes during a fundraising event. Investors involved in the funding round determine how they value the company and are given options, at that valuation, in exchange for cash.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe most important pieces of information to pay attention to are your 409A valuation, your strike price, the type of options you were granted and the preferred share price.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Since the company has now been valued higher, the 409A changes for everyone. It\u2019s also possible for the 409A to go down if, for any reason, the company is now valued at a lower amount. This is known as a \u201cdown round.\u201d Airbnb had a notable down round during the pandemic, though it eventually recovered and went public.<\/p>\n<p>Your strike price is the price at which you can buy your stock options (also known as exercising). Yes, buy. You are given the option to buy them, which is why they are called stock options. But know that your strike price will likely never change. However, if you\u2019re ever given more stock options (perhaps as a future bonus), this would be a separate grant and the strike price could be different. Companies are legally required to issue stock options at the most recent 409A price (or higher).<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The best way you can get ahead is just by understanding how your stock options work, being prepared, and knowing what questions to ask your tax or financial professionals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2176316,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"bcf228bb-f3b1-3f94-aef0-b81354c67c1e"},"categories":[25515,576818242,20429],"tags":[576846312,576846278,576601591,1654,193629],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796357],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/GettyImages-969568436.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3i9ndOg","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.4,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2148072],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/13\/here-are-3-things-you-should-do-with-your-stock-options\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176280"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2176280"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176280\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2176829,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2176280\/revisions\/2176829"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/vieje-piauwasdy"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2176280&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2176316"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2176280"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2176280"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2176280"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2176280"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2176280"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2176280"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2176280"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2148072,"name":"Vieje Piauwasdy","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/vieje-piauwasdy\/","description":"Vieje Piauwasdy is the director of Equity Strategy at <a href=\"http:\/\/secfi.com\">Secfi<\/a>, an equity planning platform for startup executives and employees.","slug":"vieje-piauwasdy","links":{"twitter":"viejep"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Vieje Piauwasdy is the director of Equity Strategy at <a href=\"http:\/\/secfi.com\">Secfi<\/a>, an equity planning platform for startup executives and employees.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"viejep"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program. \r\n\r\nPreviously, he worked at a number of startups in various roles and as City Editor of Hoodline.

recruiting diverse talent. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/14\/examining-the-pipeline-problem\/\">Some say that it\u2019s not the pipeline problem<\/a>, it\u2019s an issue with how recruitment rounds and technical interviews are conducted. Others point to success with hiring entry-level diverse talent, but then companies fail to retain and reinvest in those individuals as they progress through their career.<\/p>\n<p>While entrepreneurs continue to poke at the gap between talented, diverse individuals and scaled recruiting, a new merger today between two venture-backed companies paints an ambitious picture of what a promising solution could look like.<\/p>\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wayup.com\/\">WayUp<\/a>, a sourcing platform for diverse candidates, announced that it is merging with <a href=\"https:\/\/yello.co\/\">Yello<\/a>, a recruitment software company. The two HR tech companies will operate under Yello as a legal entity but continue to keep their independent branding with a now combined 200 employees.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe can send all the diverse applicants into applicant tracking systems or CRMs, but if companies don\u2019t have the automation workflow, and the tools and analytics that they need to make sure that those candidates are truly making their way through, then these candidates are sitting in a black hole,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/elizabethwessel\">Liz Wessel<\/a>, co-founder and CEO of WayUp, said in an interview with TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Wessel\u2019s realization of the &#8220;black hole&#8221; that candidates fell into soon turned into conversations with Yello, which she describes as the \u201cmost robust [candidate relationship management solution] in the market for early career.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, by combining forces, the startups will be able to create an end-to-end recruitment tool that helps aggregate a group of diverse candidates who have varied backgrounds from across core and non-core schools, ethnicity, majors, location, gender and ethnicity, and then place them with recruiters into a software-powered job funnel.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"K1ggDZgGJb\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/as-the-economy-reopens-startups-are-uniquely-positioned-to-recruit-talent\/\">As the economy reopens, startups are uniquely positioned to recruit talent<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;As the economy reopens, startups are uniquely positioned to recruit talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/as-the-economy-reopens-startups-are-uniquely-positioned-to-recruit-talent\/embed\/#?secret=K1ggDZgGJb\" data-secret=\"K1ggDZgGJb\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Data-driven diversity<\/h2>\n<p>Wessel has spent the past seven years building up WayUp around the concept of \u201cdata-driven diversity.\u201d The platform differentiates from other sourcing and job platforms by asking candidates to self-report race, ethnicity, gender and veteran status. As a result, employers, which are WayUp\u2019s clients, can prioritize diversity when hiring, while early-career professionals can explore curated opportunities based on their profiles.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, WayUp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/wayup-diversity-dashboard\/\">launched a dashboard<\/a> to help employers see where their recruiting process loses diverse candidates. While that dashboard was WayUp\u2019s first foray into the world of candidate recruitment management, today\u2019s merger with Yello suggests it was just foreshadowing the partnership to come.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/yello.co\/\">Yello<\/a> handles recruitment processes for companies, from top of funnel events such as career fairs through virtual candidate engagement and interview scheduling. The company has landed clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Tableau, eBay and Adobe for its sourcing, engaging and placing software.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey provide a ton of automation workflow to make it so that companies can significantly, quickly, efficiently and easily get applicants through in a fair and equitable way,\u201d Wessel said. \u201cCompanies often don\u2019t struggle with, \u2018how do I get more applicants\u2019 at the early career stage, it\u2019s really, \u2018how do I get the most qualified, diverse talented candidates hired\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yello\u2019s been working on a sourcing arm for years in its campus recruiting solution. Now, with WayUp, the database will grow to over 6 million candidates across 7,000 campuses. Candidates, while self-reported, are 71% Black, Hispanic or female, along with \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of veterans, a statement about the merger disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to offering a powerhouse of data, recruiters will benefit from the automation opportunities of two solutions from a single company,\u201d said<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/corey-ferengul-70b1\/\"> Corey Ferengul,<\/a> CEO, Yello, in a statement announcing the merger.<\/p>\n<p>Yello, which didn\u2019t previously have an explicit diversity angle in its software product, is now adding WayUp\u2019s database of talent to its suite of services. And WayUp, which didn\u2019t previously have a candidate relationship management tool, now can offer one to its talent.<\/p>\n<h2>Handshakes<\/h2>\n<p>Even with 6 million early market professionals in its sphere, the companies have a billion-dollar competitor worth paying attention to. Handshake, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/handshake-raises-80m-at-a-1-5b-valuation-as-its-diversity-focused-recruitment-network-for-grads-passes-18m-users\/\">which last raised money at a $1.5 billion valuation<\/a>, is a networking and recruitment platform for college students. The job recruiting tool recently passed 18 million users across thousands of universities, including some 120 minority-serving institutions, which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions in the U.S., as well as community colleges. Handshake\u2019s focus on diversity isn\u2019t as marketed as WayUp\u2019s, but its footprint, as well as a curated network that brings HBCUVs into conversations with its 550,000 employer clients, shows its commitment to underrepresented groups. Canvas, another venture-backed startup in the HR tech world, similarly offers a recruiting platform that is based on self-reported data, aimed at helping diverse candidates land jobs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RScJqAPiic\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent\/\">Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Canvas lands $20M so tech&#8217;s biggest companies can find diverse talent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/canvas-lands-20m-so-techs-biggest-companies-can-find-diverse-talent\/embed\/#?secret=RScJqAPiic\" data-secret=\"RScJqAPiic\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>With WayUp joining Yello\u2019s brand, it is strengthening its competitive advantage over Handshake, Canvas and other competitors by adding software services to its recruiting tool.

It provides an automated validation platform that runs scenarios to detect any gaps in a company\u2019s defenses, enabling organizations to test and measure the effectiveness of their security posture and receive guidance on how to fix what&#8217;s broken. Broadly, AttackIQ\u2019s platform helps an organization&#8217;s security teams to anticipate, prepare, and hunt for threats that may impact their business, before hackers get there first.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Its Security Optimization Platform platform, which supports Windows, Linux, and macOS across public, private, and on-premises cloud environments, is based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework<\/a>, a curated knowledge base of known adversary threats, tactics, and techniques. This is used by a number of cybersecurity companies also building continuous validation services including FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/cymulate-nabs-45m-to-test-and-improve-cybersecurity-defenses-via-attack-simulations\/\">Cymulate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>AttackIQ says this latest round of funding, which comes more than two years after its last, arrives at a \u201cdynamic time\u201d for the company. Not only has cybersecurity become more of a priority for organizations as a result of a major uptick in both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ransomware\/\">ransomware<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/05\/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware\/\">supply-chain attacks<\/a>, the company also recently accelerated its international expansion efforts through a partnership with technology distributor Westcon.<\/p>\n<p>The startup says it\u2019s planning to use these new funds to further expand internationally through its newfound partnership with Atlantic Bridge, which will also see Kevin Dillon, the company\u2019s co-founder and managing director, join the AttackIQ board of directors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAttackIQ has established itself as a category leader with a formidable enterprise customer base that includes four of the Fortune 20,\u201d said Dillon. \u201cWe believe deeply in the company\u2019s vision and potential to become the next billion-dollar cybersecurity software company and look forward to helping the company turn early traction in Europe and the Middle East into robust, long-term expansion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brett Galloway, CEO of AttackIQ, said the round &#8220;reaffirms the strength&#8221; of its platform.<\/p>\n<p>As well as enabling organizations to review the robustness of their security defenses, the startup also runs the AttackIQ Academy, which\u00a0provides free entry-level and advanced cybersecurity training.

Today, it consists of products like Gmail and Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slide Meet, Chat and Drive. Currently, Workspace is going through what may be one of its most important periods of change, too, with extensive new collaboration features and, for the first time, a <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.google.com\/individual\/?utm_source=the_keyword&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY21-Q3-GWSforeveryone&amp;utm_content=signup#individual-pricing-card\">paid individual plan<\/a>. All of this, of course, is happening against the backdrop of the pandemic, which made remote collaboration tools and video chat services like Meet more important than ever.<\/p>\n<p>All of that would be enough to make Soltera a good conversation partner for a SaaS event, but his background goes much further than that. He actually started his career as a software engineer at Netscape in the late 90s and after a few other engineering positions, co-founded launched his first startup, the monitoring service Hyperic, in 2004. Hyperic then merged with SpringSource, which was acquired by VMware, landing Soletro in the position as VMware&#8217;s CTO for its SaaS and Application Services.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s likely his next startup, the mobile-centric email startup Acompli, though, that you remember. Founded in mid-2013, Microsoft quickly acquired Acompli in late 2014 and then essentially turned into Outlook Mobile. At Microsoft, Soltero rose through the ranks to become a corporate VP for its Office group and Cortana, before decamping to Google in 2019. Since then, he&#8217;s become the public face of GSuite\/Workspace and we&#8217;ll use our time with him to talk about the joys and challenges of managing a massive SaaS product, but also about what he learned from building products from the ground up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-saas-2021\/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Register today<\/a> with a $75 early bird ticket and save $100 before tickets go up. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-saas-2021\/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=javiersoltero&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=javierpost&amp;display=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TC Sessions: SaaS<\/a> takes place on October 27 and will feature the chats with the leading minds in SaaS, networking, and startup demos.<\/p>\n<p>\t<iframe\n\t\t\tid=\"wpcom-iframe-c3280dd576e00396eceec395bb0a588b\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"99%\"\n\t\t\theight=\"1500\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/tcprotectedembed.com\/protected-iframe\/c3280dd576e00396eceec395bb0a588b\"\n\t\t\tscrolling=\"true\"\n\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\tclass=\"wpcom-protected-iframe\"\n\t>\n\t<\/iframe>\n\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-c3280dd576e00396eceec395bb0a588b')\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-c3280dd576e00396eceec395bb0a588b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, \"https:\\\/\\\/tcprotectedembed.com\" );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'tcprotectedembed.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); \/* compat for infinite scroll *\/ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t<\/script>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to big SaaS products, few are bigger than Google Workspace (formerly known as GSuite).

changes the way users reshare content they like to their Stories.<\/p>\n<p>The test, which will only appear for a subset of users, lets users see a collection of content they&#8217;ve viewed recently when they&#8217;re in the Stories section of the app. That content will be collected under a new reshare sticker, which can be found in the sticker tray when creating a Story. Posts and Reels viewed in the last hour will appear here along with recently created posts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that people sometimes find reshared content less engaging, personal, and fun,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson said of the test. &#8220;We hope that with this new test experience, people are encouraged to be more intentional and deliberate when sharing things that matter to them.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Content reshared through the sticker will appear against the backdrop of an existing Story, which could encourage more personalization. As it stands now, when users add a post of Reel to their Story, that content generally stands alone against a plain background. The new reshare Sticker adds a new way for people to contextualize content they&#8217;re resharing and makes those posts feel a bit less static (think retweets with comment rather than straight up retweeting a stranger into your feed).<\/p>\n<p>The test isn&#8217;t guaranteed to make it into the full app, but Instagram will use feedback from the new reshare feature to see if it ups the quality of reshared posts. By letting people review what the&#8217;ve seen after the fact rather than just sharing on the fly, the feature could also encourage users to reshare more through their Stories \u2014 or at least reshare more thoughtfully.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram tests new features all the time. And while test features don&#8217;t always make it into the final product, they do give an indication of what the company is thinking about when it comes to reshaping the app \u2014 and the behavior of the more than one billion people who use it on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Other recent Instagram tests have toyed with the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow\/\">hiding Like counts<\/a>\u00a0and experimented <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/23\/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics\/\">with mixing algorithmic recommendations into the app&#8217;s main feed.<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ESV8v28fOF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/01\/instagrams-latest-test-puts-all-stories-on-one-page\/\">Instagram&#8217;s latest test puts all Stories on one page<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Instagram&#8217;s latest test puts all Stories on one page&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/01\/instagrams-latest-test-puts-all-stories-on-one-page\/embed\/#?secret=ESV8v28fOF\" data-secret=\"ESV8v28fOF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sO6svIhTru\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow\/\">Instagram&#8217;s new test lets you choose if you want to hide &#8216;Likes,&#8217; Facebook test to follow<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Instagram&#8217;s new test lets you choose if you want to hide &#8216;Likes,&#8217; Facebook test to follow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow\/embed\/#?secret=sO6svIhTru\" data-secret=\"sO6svIhTru\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram is tinkering around with a new test feature that changes the way users reshare content they like to their Stories.

stage startup that wants to bring the power of search to code, announced a $125 million Series D investment today on a $2.625 billion valuation, a 3x growth from its previous valuation in December 2020, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p>The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Insight Partners, Geodesic Capital and other existing investors. The company has now raised almost $225 million, according to Crunchbase data.<\/p>\n<p>Company CEO and co-founder Quinn Slack says that we know by now that every company is building software, and as they do, they are generating tons of code. &#8220;They&#8217;re all drowning in code, and we help solve that. Our product is universal code search, which helps developers search, understand and automate code,&#8221; Slack explained.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He says that companies use Sourcegraph to find problems and vulnerabilities they might not otherwise see. Developers and site reliability engineers may see that there&#8217;s a problem, but getting to the specific part of the code where it&#8217;s happening requires a specialized tool, he says. Some of the large companies might build their own tools for this purpose, but most companies don&#8217;t have the resources and this puts code search within reach of many more developers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Universal code search that we built &#8212; and we spent a lot of time building it &#8212; is the first kind of code search that actually understands code as code and all the connections, that graph of code. And that means that if you&#8217;re a developer, you can get to that answer of how do I do this thing or how do I fix this or if I change this what&#8217;s going to break, in way less time and that&#8217;s why you need a purpose-built code search tool,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WbqmRY7bct\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/11\/circleci-announces-100m-series-f-on-1-7b-valuation-along-with-vamp-acquisition\/\">CircleCI announces $100M Series F on $1.7B valuation along with Vamp acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;CircleCI announces $100M Series F on $1.7B valuation along with Vamp acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/11\/circleci-announces-100m-series-f-on-1-7b-valuation-along-with-vamp-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=WbqmRY7bct\" data-secret=\"WbqmRY7bct\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>He says that the company was founded in 2013, but it took almost five years to build a product of this sophistication. The startup was able to get funding initially based on the potential of a tool like this. Now investors are seeing the traction they envisioned early on.<\/p>\n<p>Today they have 800,000 developers using the product over the last 12 months and Slack says that they have indexed over 54 billion lines of code. Paying customers include Plaid, Uber, GE and Atlassian. The company has around 160 employees and expects to increase that to 250 by the end of the year with all of this new capital.<\/p>\n<p>The company made the fortunate decision to go fully remote in January of 2020 just a couple of months before offices shut down in the U.S., and his plan is to continue to be remote even after offices fully reopen.<\/p>\n<p>Slack doesn&#8217;t shy away from the IPO question, saying it&#8217;s definitely something they think about. &#8220;We want to be a public company eventually, so that we can show that we&#8217;re going to be around forever.

adds a &#8216;Payout Time Bonus&#8217; to help retain bug bounty hunters"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When it comes to bug bounties, Facebook lags behind the likes of Microsoft and Google in terms of overall payouts and volume of tips received: last year, Microsoft and Google respectively paid out <a href=\"https:\/\/msrc-blog.microsoft.com\/2021\/07\/08\/microsoft-bug-bounty-programs-year-in-review-13-6m-in-rewards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$13.6 million<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/security.googleblog.com\/2021\/02\/vulnerability-reward-program-2020-year.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$6.7 million<\/a>; Facebook meanwhile paid out just $1.98 million as of <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/11\/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But on the other hand, Facebook&#8217;s a younger company and is working on improving its system to keep it on bounty hunters&#8217; radar. In the latest development, Facebook today said that it would be adding a new set of bonus rewards when it pays out on a report if more than 30 days have passed since Facebook first received it.<\/p>\n<p>The Payout Time Bonus, as Facebook is calling it, will work on a sliding scale, where payouts made between 30-59 days will get a 5% bonus; payouts made between 60-89 days will get a 7.5% bonus; and payouts made after 90 days or more will get a 10% bonus. Facebook doesn&#8217;t specify what the base amount is, but in its <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/11\/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last round of bounties<\/a>, its highest payouts per bug were as much as $80,000 and $60,000 with some $40,000 paid out in its existing bonus program. But payments might be as low as $500.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The extra money will work as a kind of incentive to bounty hunters who make a living from these tips, so that when delays happen with Facebook paying out for legitimate tips, the bug hunters know they&#8217;ll get a more lucrative reward for their work in the end \u2014 rather than get turned off from working on Facebook-property bugs altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Bug hunting has become a big business for security researchers, with some <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/12\/oversecured-mobile-app-security-bug-bounty\/\">making upwards of $1 million annually<\/a> from the programs. But bounty hunting is a double-edged sword: it definitely focuses top minds on to specific platforms, but in doing so, they spend more time there than looking for vulnerabilities in some places than others. That leads the biggest platforms to ensure that they are making their bug-ridden environments more, or as, &#8220;attractive&#8221; as others to get people to contribute to their work.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says that it determines&nbsp;bounty&nbsp;amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation, and quality of the report. &#8220;If we pay a&nbsp;bounty, the minimum reward is $500,&#8221; they told me.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We reward researchers based on the maximum possible impact of their report that we find during our own internal investigation of each&nbsp;bug, rather than based on the impact reported initially by the researcher,&#8221; they continued. &#8220;Sometimes our impact investigations can lead tosignificantly higher&nbsp;bounties&nbsp;for researchers, but they can also sometimes take more time to complete. The Payout Time Bonus is meant to also reward our researchers for their patience during this process.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our ongoing&nbsp;payout guideline series, shares more details to help external researchers better understand our payout decisions. We have published three guidelines so far and will publish more in the future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yZvHJACpww\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris\/\">The do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of bug bounty programs with Katie Moussouris<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of bug bounty programs with Katie Moussouris&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/07\/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris\/embed\/#?secret=yZvHJACpww\" data-secret=\"yZvHJACpww\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to bug bounties, Facebook lags behind the likes of Microsoft and Google in terms of overall payouts and volume of tips received: last year, Microsoft and Google respectively paid out $13.6 million and $6.7 million; Facebook meanwhile paid out just $1.98 million as of November.

Following up on late-last year\u2019s release of the entry-level Portrait, the startup is offering new versions of the Looking Glass 4K and 8K systems, which sport 15.6- and 32-inch displays, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to sizes, there\u2019s a pretty massive gulf in pricing here. Joining the $299 Portrait is the $3,000 4K and $17,500 8K. The pricing difference is all the more pronounced given that the tech essentially offers the same underlying technologies for producing and consuming 3D content.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2176398\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2176398\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2176398\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/4k___t-rex-by-Ashkan-Azarmi.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2176398\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Looking Glass<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cVolume is a part of it,\u201d CEO Shawn Frayne tells TechCrunch. \u201cThere are actually very few 8K displays out in the world at this size that folks are driving. While we expect the sale of that to be quite profound over the next few years, in the early phases we\u2019re just not making the same scale as the Portrait.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company considers the Portrait a kind of ambassador for its technology &#8212; especially over the past year, when getting the systems in front of potential buyers was next to impossible. Having seen a number of Looking Glass\u2019 older systems in person, I can attest to the fact that the effect really isn\u2019t the same over Zoom.

We had nearly 4,000 recommendations from founders \u2014 often with extensive documentation that in some cases exceeded 1000 words. From our initial edition to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/30\/the-techcrunch-list-update\/\">several extensive updates<\/a>, we ultimately selected 531 investors.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experiment used by hundreds of thousands of people with surprisingly deep engagement (people <i>really<\/i> love reading lists, apparently). Nonetheless, we are officially retiring the product today.<\/p>\n<p>The reason is simple: the venture capital industry has radically changed over the past year, and the central thesis we used in constructing the list no longer applies.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When we designed the list \u2014 which, to be clear, was never a ranking \u2014 we organized experienced investors across three main axes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Specialization<\/b>: We believed that investor specialization mattered. We wanted to match biotech founders with biotech investors and ecommerce companies with ecommerce VCs. The bulk of our work reading through all those founder recommendations was identifying the brilliant investors in 31 different market categories who could offer differentiated strategic advice.<\/li>\n<li><b>Stage<\/b>: We wanted to match founders with investors who would invest at the stage their companies were at, ranging from pre-seed to growth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Geography<\/b>: We believed that local investors would have an edge over distant investors for founders, particularly at the earliest stages where regular counseling would be useful to reaching product-market fit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In other words, we took a very strong view that capital wasn\u2019t a commodity, and that the right investor could radically change the trajectory of a founder\u2019s ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>When we started putting together the plans for The TechCrunch List in January 2020, the pandemic was just starting to spread around the world, and many of these assumptions still held true. However, as I think we have all seen, those assumptions have been completely upended over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>The reality today is that capital has never been cheaper or more commodity. VCs invest rapidly, in all geographies, at all stages, in all industries, constantly, rapidly, and all the time.<\/p>\n<p>I constantly heard this feedback over the past few months from both founders and investors. For founders, the focus on terms and price seem to consistently outrank nearly any other factor in building a relationship with an investor. Few founders would ever countenance lowering the valuations of their companies for a more experienced or specialized investor or an investor who was located locally. At the same price, these factors could differentiate one investor from another, but otherwise, price prevails, pretty much every single time.<\/p>\n<p>Commensurately, VCs (and this applies most heavily at big funds of course) no longer care about any guidelines or theses around investing. Any stage, any geography, any market \u2014 if there is a deal to be done, they get it done and quickly. Tiger Global and SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund dominate this narrative, but there are at least a good dozen other firms that have similar styles these days. And given these are some of the largest firms by assets under management, they also just dominate the term sheets flying around the startup world.<\/p>\n<p>If The TechCrunch List was about bringing signal to the noise of fundraising in order to save founders serious time and work, the reality is that the market today is just complete noise and frenetic chaos, and there truly isn\u2019t much to be done to clarify that. The upshot is that VCs make decisions with more alacrity than ever before, so the good news is that the chaos should be short-lived for founders today.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s next? We\u2019ll continue experimenting with ways to help founders fundraise and find the best investors for them.

turning it into a betting opportunity, using the prospect of winning (or losing) cold hard cash to motivate people to get off the couch, has collected $1.5 million in seed funds from Sam &amp; Max Altman\u2019s Apollo VC and the student-focused Dorm Room Fund.<\/p>\n<p>The app itself has been around since 2018 but in March 2020 it launched a &#8220;challenge model&#8221; that lets users stake money to join a challenge related to a specific fitness goal &#8212; be it running 10 miles in 10 days, or walking three miles in three days.<\/p>\n<p>Participants who achieve the challenge goal get their stake back and a pro-rata share of losers&#8217; staked entry fees.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>A range of fitness levels are catered to by Cadoo&#8217;s challenges (&#8220;from daily steps to marathon training&#8221;), with some 50 public challenges hosted per week.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also adding private challenges this month &#8212; which will enable users to host and configure fitness challenges for themselves\/family and friends, or larger groups, such as companies, clubs, or schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Challenge-related activity is verified by <span class=\"il\">the app<\/span> via API data from activity trackers and fitness apps. (Which hopefully means Cadoo is smart enough to detect if someone has attached their Fitbit to their dog&#8230; )<\/p>\n<p>The app has support for a number of third party fitness services, including Strava, Fitbit and Apple Health.<\/p>\n<p>CEO and founder <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colm Hayden describes the startup as &#8220;DraftKings for your own fitness goals&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our audience consists of 25-50 year old fitness fanatics&#8217; who use <span class=\"il\">Cadoo<\/span> to stay committed to their monthly\/weekly fitness goals,&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he<\/span> told TechCrunch, adding: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;When people are serious about a goal they are trying to reach, they want intense motivation to back their ambitions.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>He says the app has attracted around 7,000 wager-loving users so far.<\/p>\n<p>Cadoo&#8217;s business model is based on taking a fee from challenge losers before their entry fee stakes are distributed to challenge winners &#8212; which does potentially give the business an incentive to set harder challenges than users are able to complete.<\/p>\n<p>But of course it&#8217;s up to users to pick which challenges to enter and thereby commit their hard earned cash to.<\/p>\n<p>It also claims that 90% of users who sign up for Cadoo challenges successfully complete them.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hayden says it has future plans to expand monetization potential by offer<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing winners fitness products &#8212; and taking a margin on those <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">products. And also by expanding into other types of verifiable goals, not just running\/walking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are working to build a motivation platform that enables anybody to reach their goals,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Financial incentives is an intense motivator, and 90% of users who sign up for Cadoo challenges reach their fitness goals. We are making Cadoo much bigger than just running goals, and in the future incentivizing almost any goal verifiable on the internet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While the app is US-based payments are processed by PayPal and <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hayden says it&#8217;s able to support participation internationally &#8212; at least <\/span>everywhere where PayPal is available.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the seed raise in a statement, Apollo VC&#8217;s Altman brothers added: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCadoo makes it easy to motivate users to stay active with financial incentives. We believe the motivation industry that Cadoo is pioneering will be an important digital money use-case.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Before the seed round, Cadoo says it had raised<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $350,000 via <\/span>an angel round from Tim Parsa\u2019s Cloud Money Ventures Angel Syndicate, Wintech Ventures, and Daniel Gross&#8217;s Pioneer.<\/p>\n<p>Of course gamification of health is nothing new &#8212; given the data-fuelled quantification and goal-based motivation that&#8217;s been going on around fitness for years, fuelled by wearables that make it trivially easy to track steps, distances, calories burned etc.<\/p>\n<p>But injecting money into the mix adds another competitive layer that may be helpful for motivating a certain type of person to get or stay fit.<\/p>\n<p>Cadoo isn&#8217;t the only fitness-focused startup to be taking this tack, either, though &#8212; with a number of apps that pay users to lose weight or otherwise be active (albeit, sometimes less directly by paying them in digital currency that can be exchanged for &#8216;rewards&#8217;). <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Others in the space include the likes of <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/09\/14\/tc50-healthywage-pays-you-to-get-in-better-shape\/\">HealthyWage<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> (a TC50 company we covered all the way back in 2009!); Runtopia and StepBet, to name a few.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"R8byTC9ijm\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/01\/the-future-of-sports-tech-heres-where-investors-are-placing-their-bets\/\">The future of sports tech: Here\u2019s where investors are placing their bets<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The future of sports tech: Here\u2019s where investors are placing their bets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/01\/the-future-of-sports-tech-heres-where-investors-are-placing-their-bets\/embed\/#?secret=R8byTC9ijm\" data-secret=\"R8byTC9ijm\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"n6C6MJQW5z\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/\">It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/embed\/#?secret=n6C6MJQW5z\" data-secret=\"n6C6MJQW5z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cadoo, a US-startup that&#8217;s gamifying fitness by turning it into a betting opportunity, using the prospect of winning (or losing) cold hard cash to motivate people to get off the couch, has collected $1.5 million in seed funds from Sam &amp; Max Altman\u2019s Apollo VC and the student-focused Dorm Room Fund.

It\u2019s a gap <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marcofi.com\/\">Marco Financial<\/a> is looking to bridge through its tech-enabled risk assessment platform that can provide better insight on who should receive loans.<\/p>\n<p>To continue its mission, the Miami-based trade finance company raised $7 million in seed funding and $75 million in a credit facility, led by Arcadia Funds LLC and Kayyak Ventures, to increase its credit line to $100 million. Marco was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/21\/miami-based-marco-is-offering-revenue-based-lending-for-latin-american-companies\/\">backed last September by a small seed round<\/a> from Struck Capital and Antler and over $20 million in a credit facility underwritten by Arcadia Funds.<\/p>\n<p>Additional investors in the newest seed round and expanded credit facility include Village Global VC, Flexport Ventures, Tresalia Capital, 342 Capital, Struck Capital, Antler LLC, Antler Elevate, Florida Funders and Fox Ventures.

Spradling through the Antler accelerator, a Singapore- and New York-based early-stage investment and advisory services program that connects entrepreneurs and tech operators to launch new businesses. They started Marco in 2019 and now have offices in New York, Dallas and across Latin America.<\/p>\n<p>Spradling was born in Uruguay and knows firsthand about the challenges of importing and exporting from working in his family\u2019s slaughterhouse and later founding three of his own companies. In fact, one of his businesses imported e-cigarettes \u2014 his mother was a lifelong smoker, and he wanted to help her quit. He recalls pre-selling his inventory at a discount in order to get the money to import the goods.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBanks don\u2019t like risk, which means businesses spend most of their time trying to get financing rather than increasing sales,\u201d Spradling told TechCrunch. \u201cBanks in Latin America have a saying that \u2018they lend money to people who don\u2019t need it.\u2019 Families with money can access the banks, but you can\u2019t launch a business without capital, and many owners lack that access to banks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marco\u2019s factoring product enables new companies to get started without having to put up the significant amount of collateral that banks are asking. Banks typically look at financial statements for the past two years of the business and give a line of credit accordingly. Not needing as much collateral also enables more women in Latin America to become business owners because they often don\u2019t have collateral, Spradling said.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, Marco reduces risk by basing its lines of credit on an analysis of the future potential of the business, thereby freeing up cash so that small and medium exporters can continue their operations and invest in their growth. The company is able to show what kind of financing can be obtained based on the amount of data customers provide. Marco also said it can reduce the loan origination process from over two months to one week and provide funding to approved exporters within 24 hours.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qTXbm9W76i\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/17\/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains\/\">How tech can build more resilient supply chains<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How tech can build more resilient supply chains&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/17\/how-tech-can-build-more-resilient-supply-chains\/embed\/#?secret=qTXbm9W76i\" data-secret=\"qTXbm9W76i\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Crist\u00f3bal Silva Lombardi, general partner at Kayyak Ventures, told TechCrunch that Marco is providing an alternative for small and medium exporters to access capital that they previously had to get from friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>In countries like Chile, electronic invoicing innovation has enabled the factoring industry to grow, and in turn, companies like Marco tend to become leaders in supply chain financing and shrink the high interest rates spread between small businesses and large firms.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarco wants to take that worldwide,\u201d Silva Lombardi said. \u201cThere is a lot of value to tackle. Factoring is one of the corners in the financing market that hasn\u2019t been tackled, and by using technology, Marco is building and creating value for the whole society. This is where venture capital firms should be putting their dollars \u2014 in companies where technology and talent unleash a lot of value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since launching its product in January 2020, the company has processed thousands of invoices across 20 countries, amounting to more than $18 million.<\/p>\n<p>However, it wasn\u2019t easy in the beginning, according to Shoihet. Starting during the global pandemic, Marco initially had challenges accessing the market due to exports and supply chains being strained.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Marco has found its groove and is lending as little as $25,000 per month and as much as $10 million, Shoihet said.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the new funding will go toward simplifying cross-border payments, assessing risk and productizing ways to take unstructured data, processes and work to create a better experience for the customer. The company also said it aims to give large logistics providers the ability to finance exports on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Marco was also able to attract new leadership, including Prajwal Manalwar, chief product officer, and Sabrina Teichman, chief growth officer. Manalwar worked for 13 years at PayPal, where he most recently was a product lead focused on debit card authorization rates and in-store payments. Teichman joins after 11 years with the U.S. government, most recently serving as managing director for the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow we can work on how to solve the problem at a larger scale by building infrastructure and information through the underwriting process and through partnerships from larger players in shipping, trade services and insurance \u2014 all incumbent industries that have clients with working capital,\u201d Shoihet said. \u201cBy innovating the underwriting process, we can come to better conclusions and be the trade finance-as-a-service provider to clients in emerging markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"n44KRXor5F\"><p><a

Specifically, Ramp said it now offers its customers the option to approve or block merchants on the cards they offer to their employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Ramp co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said the move was in response to customer demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis was one of our most requested features, especially from companies with over 100 employees,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThey said, \u2018I can block a spam call.

It allows companies to outline specifically who employees can spend with, which vendors can be charged on what card and how much they can charge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why is this a big deal? Glyman said this means that merchant-specific cards greatly reduce the risk from stolen or compromised cards. It also helps keep employees from inflating expenses or filing false reimbursement claims.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis gives security and control back to finance teams in a way that was never before possible,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also helps companies in their quest to save money by using corporate credit cards in the first place, Glyman added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor example, they can restrict spending to businesses or companies that they have discounts or preferential pricing with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another layer of enforcement for finance teams.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process was not an easy one since understanding and clustering unique identifiers to be able to identify merchants was \u201ctechnically complex,\u201d according to Glyman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For its part, Ramp counts \u201cthousands\u201d of businesses as customers, with well into the tens of thousands of individuals using its cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2sOflCQqLO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com\/\">Brex, Ramp tout their view of the future as Divvy is said to consider a sale to Bill.com<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Brex, Ramp tout their view of the future as Divvy is said to consider a sale to Bill.com&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/04\/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com\/embed\/#?secret=2sOflCQqLO\" data-secret=\"2sOflCQqLO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re powering into nine figures monthly and over $1 billion in spend,\u201d Glyman said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company must be doing something right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since raising the credit line earlier this year, Ramp has seen continued growth, more than doubling volume over the past three months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Glyman declined to reveal specific revenue figures, he said Ramp grew by more than 6,000% in 2020, compared to the year prior, and has grown over 1,000% over the past 12 months. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers are typically fast-growing startups as well as small businesses.

tech to stay competitive in the coming decades, as it and other automakers prepare for the largest transition in personal mobility since the invention of the car.<\/p>\n<p>Laying out the company strategy Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess emphasized a top-to-bottom transformation in everything from manufacturing to revenue streams. If revenue was historically driven by sales of internal combustion engine vehicles, Volkswagen CFO Arno Antlitz said the rest of the decade bring income derived not only from electric vehicle sales, but also software, autonomous driving and even ridesharing.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, the company has been busy, planning six battery Gigafactories in Europe and an \u20ac800 million ($944 million) hardware platform research and development facility in West Berlin. The company\u2019s also beefing up its in-house automotive software arm Cariad, which VW said could generate as much as \u20ac1.2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in revenue by 2030, via subscriptions and other sales.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Volkswagen also has big plans for autonomous driving. The company wants to take a chunk of the market share from ridesharing and car rental, and it sees an integrated AV platform as the way to do it. Executives painted a vivid picture of customers being able to request a Volkswagen electric AV taxi or shuttle by the end of the decade, one that may not even include a steering wheel or driver\u2019s seat, according to renderings shown during the presentation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine that your grandmother or your eight-year-old son can hop in a Volkswagen cab to visit one another, whenever they want, without mom or dad behind the wheel,\u201d Diess suggested. \u201cYou can use one of our mobility apps, and an ID Buzz will pick you up and your friends.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Personal vehicles will be powered by Cariad, which the OEM said will have \u201clevel 4 readiness\u201d by 2025. Shared mobility vehicles, like shuttles or taxis, will also be VW-owned and operated, and run on tech developed by AV company Argo AI. Volkswagen closed a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/01\/self-driving-vehicle-startup-argo-ai-completes-2-6b-deal-with-volkswagen-expands-to-europe\/\">$2.6 billion investment<\/a> in the startup last June.<\/p>\n<p>Europe\u2019s largest automaker anticipates its investments in MaaS will pay off: The company expects annual revenues of over $70 billion in the five largest European markets alone by 2030, Christian Senger, CTO of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, said. The autonomous rideshare ID Buzz, which is being tested in a pilot project in Munich, will be rolled out as a commercial service in Hamburg in 2025, followed shortly by the U.S.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2176708\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2176708\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2176708\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png 2032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=300,168 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=768,429 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=680,380 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=1536,859 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-08.38.46.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2176708\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volkswagenag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volkswagen <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In line with these estimates, the automaker anticipates BEV sales will account for 25% of sales by 2025 and 50% by 2030. ICE margins will likely come under increased pressure due to declining demand, tighter emissions regulations and comparative tax disadvantages, so Volkswagen plans to decrease its number of ICE models by 60% in Europe by 2030.

seen,&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0is rolling out new but long overdue security and privacy features.<\/p>\n<p>The Amazon-owned company&#8217;s reputation was bruised after a spate of account breaches in late 2019, in which hackers broke into Ring user accounts and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2019\/12\/12\/she-installed-ring-camera-her-childrens-room-peace-mind-hacker-accessed-it-harassed-her-year-old-daughter\/\">harassed children in their own homes<\/a>. Then, taking advantage of Ring&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/epg4xm\/amazon-ring-camera-security\">weak security practices<\/a>, hackers developed bespoke software to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/3a88k5\/how-hackers-are-breaking-into-ring-cameras\">brute-force the passwords<\/a> on Ring accounts, which at this point were only protected by the user&#8217;s password. All the while, there were several caches of Ring user passwords floating around the dark web. Ring initially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/2020\/1\/17\/21068703\/amazon-ring-hacks-lawsuit-passwords\">blamed its users<\/a> for using weak passwords (like &#8220;password&#8221; and &#8220;12345678,&#8221; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/30\/ring-security-control-center\/\">Ring allowed<\/a> users to set as passwords), but a couple of months later the company acknowledged its failings by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/18\/ring-slightly-overhauls-security-and-privacy-but-its-still-not-enough\/\">rolling out<\/a> mandatory two-factor authentication by text message. It was a good start, aimed at making it more difficult \u2014 albeit only slightly \u2014 to curb the bulk of automated account hijacks.<\/p>\n<p>But now Ring is going a step further by rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/25\/cybersecurity-101-guide-two-factor\/\">app-based two-factor authentication<\/a>, which many companies already offer (and have for some time) as it provides the far more secure delivery of two-factor codes using an encrypted connection, compared to text messages, which are susceptible to interception.<\/p>\n<p>Ring is also enabling CAPTCHA in its apps to add another hurdle aimed at making automated login attempts more difficult by prompting users to prove they aren&#8217;t a robot.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uVGduPGQaH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/whos-funding-privacy-tech\/\">Who&#8217;s funding privacy tech?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Who&#8217;s funding privacy tech?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/whos-funding-privacy-tech\/embed\/#?secret=uVGduPGQaH\" data-secret=\"uVGduPGQaH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Also announced is the launch of video end-to-end encryption, which Ring first rolled out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/ring-to-offer-opt-in-end-to-end-encryption-for-videos-beginning-later-this-year\/\">earlier this year<\/a> as a technical preview. One of Ring&#8217;s most flaunted (though highly controversial) features is allowing users to share video footage directly with more than 1,800 local police departments that are partnered with Ring. That said, police with a search warrant can always just <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/08\/ring-police-warrants-neighbors\/\">demand the footage from Ring<\/a> instead. Video end-to-end encryption will mean that any video captured from a Ring device can only be accessed by the account owner \u2014 and not Ring, or any of its law enforcement partners.<\/p>\n<p>Ring&#8217;s CTO Josh Roth said <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ring.com\/products-innovation\/ring-announces-international-availability-of-video-end-to-end-encryption\">in a blog post<\/a> that Ring believes that &#8220;our customers should control who sees their videos.&#8221; If that were true, Ring would have switched on end-to-end encryption to all users, giving every account owner privacy by default. But that would interfere with the company&#8217;s efforts to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/technology\/story\/2021-06-17\/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department\">expand its police partnerships<\/a>, which in turn help to get Ring devices into the hands of local residents.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to past security updates, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/18\/ring-slightly-overhauls-security-and-privacy-but-its-still-not-enough\/\">didn&#8217;t go nearly far enough<\/a>, Ring&#8217;s new features make meaningful changes that give users the choice to make their accounts more secure and their data private. But the keyword there is &#8220;choice,&#8221; since users will have to opt-in to the new features. That isn&#8217;t unusual in itself; companies seldom force security changes on users, fearing that it would add friction to the user experience &#8212; though recovering from an account hack because of poor security controls is undoubtedly worse.<\/p>\n<p>Switching to app-based two-factor authentication is easy,\u00a0just go to Ring&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/account.ring.com\/account\/app\/my-details\">account settings<\/a> and switch from codes sent by text message to codes delivered by an authenticator app. We have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/25\/cybersecurity-101-guide-two-factor\/\">a whole explainer<\/a> on why it&#8217;s important, why you should use an app and which apps you might want to use.<\/p>\n<p>But the biggest change Ring users can make is to <a href=\"https:\/\/account.ring.com\/account\/control-center\/video-encryption\/advanced-settings\/end-to-end\">switch on end-to-end encryption<\/a> on their accounts by going through the advanced settings of Ring&#8217;s control center. Switching on end-to-end encryption won&#8217;t limit what you can do with your account or stop you from sharing video footage with friends, family or the police, but it will give you peace of mind knowing that you will have control of your data and what you do with it, and not Ring.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IGnNI5gpsv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/08\/ring-police-warrants-neighbors\/\">Ring refuses to say how many users had video footage obtained by police<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ring refuses to say how many users had video footage obtained by police&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/08\/ring-police-warrants-neighbors\/embed\/#?secret=IGnNI5gpsv\" data-secret=\"IGnNI5gpsv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ring, the video doorbell maker dubbed the &#8220;largest civilian surveillance network the U.S. has ever seen,&#8221;\u00a0is rolling out new but long overdue security and privacy features.

going the way of the dodo bird for many companies, regulators and platforms, and that&#8217;s giving a new emphasis on technology that will help companies better manage their customer data on their own steam. Today, one of the companies building tools for that end is announcing a big round of funding, underscoring its growth.<\/p>\n<p>Amperity, which provides a customer data platform for its businesses, has raised $100 million in funding at a valuation of over $1 billion. The startup typically works with large, consumer-focused enterprises along the lines of Starbucks, Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, Patagonia and some 100 others, helping them to tap and organize their own data troves better to develop better profiles of their customers.<\/p>\n<p>The Series D funding &#8212; led by HighSage Ventures with previous backers Tiger Global Management, Declaration Partners, Madrona Venture Group and Madera Technology Partners also participating &#8212; brings the total raised by Amperity to $187 million and comes two years after the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Series C of $50 million<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The last year of increased online activity and online shopping has put a much bigger focus on the data that companies are amassing about their users and how they can better leverage that information to grow further. Amperity said that in 2020, annual recurring revenues were up 100%, partly on the back of that surge of interest in how to tap into customer data, not least because the older way of doing things has fallen out of favor.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CJoPmmZDD6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/\">Customer data management company Amperity raises $50M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Customer data management company Amperity raises $50M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/amperity-series-c\/embed\/#?secret=CJoPmmZDD6\" data-secret=\"CJoPmmZDD6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Indeed, Kabir Shahani, the CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Derek Slager, believes that the trend away from third-party to first-party data has played and will play a much bigger role in Amperity&#8217;s growth longer term.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID certainly &#8216;helped,&#8217; &#8221; Shahani said, &#8220;but to me the story is less about that and more about how our idea has been validated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The idea he and Slager had been thinking about was the dependency, and problems with, third-party cookies, an issue that has been lingering &#8220;for decades,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When this idea started percolating, when we looked to start the company, we thought this must have already been solved. It was mind-blowing that it hadn&#8217;t.&#8221; The reason why: Data is in too many silos, and it&#8217;s not connected, which renders it impossible or at the least very challenging to use.<\/p>\n<p>Amperity&#8217;s approach has been to build the connectivity to bring the data together out of its silos, and then to create ways to merge and make it useful. In that regard, it&#8217;s not unlike another company that also got some funding today, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/quantexa-raises-153m\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantexa<\/a>, which originally built something similar to track fraud but is now also going after the customer data platform business as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9RG5cIw78l\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/quantexa-raises-153m\/\">Quantexa raises $153M to build out AI-based big data tools to track risk and run investigations<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Quantexa raises $153M to build out AI-based big data tools to track risk and run investigations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/quantexa-raises-153m\/embed\/#?secret=9RG5cIw78l\" data-secret=\"9RG5cIw78l\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>As with Quantexa, Amperity has taken the approach of treating this like a big-data problem that AI can help solve.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At the root of this is a hard computer science problem, all the disparate data runs off different keys,&#8221; he said. Some customer identifiers are based on phone numbers, some on physical addresses, some on email, and so on. &#8220;To connect all that you need one single key, but no one had done that before.

Their patented deep technology is cleaner, faster and 4x more profitable than current lithium-ion battery recycling and the only technology to fully rejuvenate the battery cathode. For two decades lithium-ion batteries have been our preferred source of portable energy, but the sad reality is that with a lifespan of only 1 \u2013 3 years, 95% end up as dangerous landfill. The precious metals used to manufacture them are often mined in socially and environmentally damaging ways. They are not being recycled, because it is simply not economical to do so with current technology. Green Li-ion changes this by removing inefficient processes and improving the purity of the output, making lithium-ion battery rejuvenation and reuse the new reality.
